Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. It involves training models on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new data. Common types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications of machine learning span various fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
